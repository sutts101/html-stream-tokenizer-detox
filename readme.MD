# HTML Stream Tokenizer - Detox

This was for my [Code Detox - Patterns for reversing the rot](https://www.meetup.com/Agile-Perth/events/27199581/) talk at Agile Meetup Perth...

> All too often, software rots like a piece of bad meat. It gets ever harder to add new features, bug fixes trigger more bugs, productivity 
> flatlines, and the clamour for a big bang rewrite begins.
>
> In this talk Ian Sutton (from ThoughtWorks) will demonstrate patterns and strategies for reversing the rot. He'll take a real world code base, 
> hone in on the warts, and whip out the ointments and salves. This one's for the technically inclined - Ian will be forgoing fancy looking slides and 
> drilling down into code ... lots of code.

So for this I grabbed a (not very good) real world code base - an inherently dubious "HTML Stream Tokenizer" - not too big but also not too small - 
and set about tidying it up. Demo'd the approach realtime as part of the talk, along with jumping backwards and forwards through the commit history.
